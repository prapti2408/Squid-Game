 Red Light Green Light – Motion tracking using OpenCV
 ✅ Dalgona Candy Challenge – Precision-based shape carving
 ✅ Bridge Game – Probability-driven decision-making

🕹️ How to Play?

🔴 Red Light Green Light: Move forward when the light is green, but stop immediately when it turns red! Motion detection with OpenCV will eliminate you if you move at the wrong time! Goal is to press the 'W' key of keyboard

🍪 Dalgona Candy Challenge: Carefully trace the given shape using your mouse without crossing the lines. One wrong move, and you’re out!

🌉 Bridge Game: Choose between two tiles to step forward—one is safe, and the other will break beneath you. Choose wisely or face elimination!

💡 How We Built It:
We spent 3 weeks coding, debugging, and ensuring players weren’t unfairly eliminated (okay, maybe sometimes!). The toughest part? Fine-tuning motion detection, balancing randomness, and optimizing real-time processing.
🛠️ Tech Stack:
🚀 Python – Game logic & event handling
 🎮 Pygame – Smooth animations & interactions
 👀 OpenCV – Real-time movement detection
 📊 NumPy & PIL – Image processing
 🔊 Pygame Mixer – Immersive sound effects
